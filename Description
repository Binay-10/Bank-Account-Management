A **simple Bank Account Management System** implemented in Java using **Encapsulation**, **Constructors**, and **Arrays**. This project simulates basic banking operations, allowing users to manage multiple accounts and perform transactions in a console-based environment.

## Features

- **Encapsulation:** All account details (account number, holder name, balance) are private with public methods to control access.  
- **Constructors:** Initialize accounts with custom details for easy setup.  
- **Arrays:** Efficiently manage multiple accounts in a single structure.  
- **Banking Operations:**
  - Deposit money into any account.
  - Withdraw money from an account with balance verification.
  - Display account information, including current balance.
- **Interactive Menu:** Users can repeatedly perform operations until they choose to exit.  
- **Input Validation:** Ensures correct account selection and prevents overdrawing.

2. Show a menu with options: deposit, withdraw, display account, or exit.  
3. Users input their account number to select the correct account.  
4. Perform the requested operation (deposit, withdraw, display).  
5. Update account balances and show results.  
6. Loop until the user exits.

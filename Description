A **simple Bank Account Management System** implemented in Java using **Encapsulation**, **Constructors**, and **Arrays**. This project simulates basic banking operations, allowing users to manage multiple accounts and perform transactions in a console-based environment.

## Features

- **Encapsulation:** All account details (account number, holder name, balance) are private with public methods to control access.  
- **Constructors:** Initialize accounts with custom details for easy setup.  
- **Arrays:** Efficiently manage multiple accounts in a single structure.  
- **Banking Operations:**
  - Deposit money into any account.
  - Withdraw money from an account with balance verification.
  - Display account information, including current balance.
- **Interactive Menu:** Users can repeatedly perform operations until they choose to exit.  
- **Input Validation:** Ensures correct account selection and prevents overdrawing.
